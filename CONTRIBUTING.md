# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Atlas! While mainly developed and managed by [one person](https://github.com/NotSylver), contributions from any are openly welcomed.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or over on the [Atlas Bot Discord](https://atlasbot.xyz/support) with Sylver before making your changes.

Atlas is an open source bot and we love to receive contributions from our community - you! There are many ways to contribute, be it updating and improving our [documentation](https://github.com/atlasbot/docs) or adding a new command/tag to the bot itself, translating the bot on our [Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/getatlas), or even writing custom commands and uploading them to our [Community Command repository](https://github.com/itsdoddsy/atlas-custom-commands).

We ask that you only submit PRs for meaningful changes. Things like spelling mistakes are minor and can probably be fixed through our Crowdin page, or by notifying Sylver.

## Pull Request Process

Before submitting a pull request, please:

1. Make sure your code works on a local instance of Atlas and has been thoroughly tested.
2. Ensure your code has been adequately commented and is readable at first glance.
3. If you're adding a new command, make sure you have added an appropriate entry in the English locale file. Make it descriptive!
4. If you're adding a new tag, make sure you describe exactly what your tag does, and include some examples. Check other tags if you're not sure what to include.

## Important notes

Any contributions you make that are accepted and merged will be covered under the [GNU GPL 3.0 license](https://github.com/atlasbot/bot/blob/master/LICENSE) that the rest of the repo follows. If you feel you have a concern with this, please contact Sylver.

## Got a suggestion?

We love having new ideas on what to add to Atlas, but we'd like to keep them off GitHub. If you're not able to develop it, we have a suggestions channel on the official Support server where you can suggest new things to be added. It's community-backed too - everyone can vote on your idea!
