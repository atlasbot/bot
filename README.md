A Discord bot that does ~~all~~ most of the things - [atlasbot.xyz](https://atlasbot.xyz)

**This is Atlas 8.0, an unfinished version of Atlas**. Source code for pre-8.0 versions will not be made public. The code here isn't finished, and while it should work fine, it's missing a lot of the features the live version has. Slowly they'll be ported over. Contributions are welcome.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >v10
- MongoDB
- [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/get-atlas/bot.git
   ```

2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the env variables

4. Start the bot with `npm start`

_\* Optional, but some features may not work without them._

## A minor note on tags

The current implementation from [nirewen/tatsuscript](https://github.com/nirewen/tatsuscript) is more or less temporary to test plugins that rely on tags (like actions). It will be replaced soon:tm: or cleaned up/overhauled.

## Disclaimer / Warning

This is a very early version of 8.0, which means many features from 7.x are missing. Some features are still being ported over, be patient. Additionally, if you find any issues, tell us or submit a PR to get it fixed.
