A Discord bot that does ~~all~~ most of the things - [atlasbot.xyz](https://atlasbot.xyz)

This is all the code that runs the bot portion of Atlas. The dashboard, API and other secret sauce will remain closed source for now. Contributions are welcome.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=10.0.0 (not required for self-hosting)

## Installation

### Self-hosting

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/get-atlas/bot.git
   ```

3. Open a terminal in the cloned folder

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required env variables

5. Start the bot with `docker-compose up -d`

### Development

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/get-atlas/bot.git
   ```

2. Open a terminal in the cloned folder

3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the env variables

5. Start Lavalink, Redis and Mongo via `docker-compose up -d mongo lavalink redis`

   If you are using docker-compose to host these services, you can leave the defaults in `.env.example` for those services and it should be gucci.

6. Start the bot with `npm start`

7. Start breaking things
