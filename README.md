# DEPRECATED

This repository is now mostly over two years old. The code practices used within are horrible, disgusting hacks that you should avoid. People keep showing up in our [support server](https://atlasbot.xyz/support) asking about self-hosting Atlas and link to this repo, so I'm going to try and shoot down any future attempts. I want to make this really clear:

- **This repository is only here for archival purposes.**
- **The code in this repository is _terrible_.** If you want to learn to code, this is not the example you should be using.
- **Self-hosting this version of the bot will lead to nothing but trouble.** There are known security vulnerabilities with this version of the bot that **will not** be fixed.
- **The public instance of Atlas is **not** using this code.** The new version is closed-source - you can't host it yourself.

If you're still curious, the old readme has been kept intact as [README-OLD.md](./README-OLD.md). If you have questions about this repository or newer versions of Atlas, join our [support server](https://atlasbot.xyz/support) and ask in #off-topic.
